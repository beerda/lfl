abstract = "The aim of this paper is, first, to introduce two new types of fuzzy integrals, namely, ⊗-fuzzy integral and →-fuzzy integral. The first integral is based on a fuzzy measure of L-fuzzy sets and the second one on a complementary fuzzy measure of L-fuzzy sets, where L is a complete residuated lattice. Some of their properties and a relation to the fuzzy (Sugeno) integral are investigated. Second, using these integrals, two classes of monadic L-fuzzy quantifiers of type 〈1〉 are defined. These L-fuzzy quantifiers can be used for modeling the semantics of natural language quantifiers like “all”, “some”, “many”, “none”, “at most half”, etc. Several semantic properties of these L-fuzzy quantifiers are studied."

Techniques are developed for automatically discarding statistically insignificant exploratory rules that cannot survive a hypothesis with regard to its ancestors. We call such insignificant rules derivative extended rules. In this paper, we argue that there is another type of derivative exploratory rules, which is derivative with regard to their children. We also argue that considerable amount of such derivative partial rules can not be successfully removed using existing rule pruning techniques. We propose a new technique to address this problem. Experiments are done in impact rule discovery to evaluate the effect of this derivative partial rule filter. Results show that the inherent problem of too many resulting rules in exploratory rule discovery is alleviated.},
